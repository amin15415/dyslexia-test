# Online Dyslexia Testing
The DESD is a screening test that allows for assessment of a student's specific reading difficulties and whether the student is at risk for dyslexia. The test identifies the specific skills that a child brings to bear on the task of reading words. It consists of three sections: Decoding, Eidetic Encoding, and Phonetic Encoding.

The Decoding section provides a measure of sight-word recognition (Reading Standard Score). Indicators in the Encoding section allow the examiner to distinguish deficits in sight-word recognition from deficits in phonetic analysis. This makes it easier to detect and describe reading problems and to refer students for appropriate educational therapy.
