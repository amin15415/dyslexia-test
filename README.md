# Online Dyslexia Testing - DESD (Decoding Encoding Screener for Dyslexia)
Overview
The Dyslexia Evaluation and Screening Device (DESD) is an online tool designed to assess reading difficulties and identify the risk of dyslexia for both children and adults. The test evaluates the specific skills an individual uses when reading words, making it easier to detect reading issues and refer them for suitable educational therapy. The DESD is divided into three main sections: Decoding, Eidetic Encoding, and Phonetic Encoding.

Sections
1. Decoding
The Decoding section measures sight-word recognition by calculating a Reading Standard Score. This score provides an indication of an individual's ability to recognize and read common words quickly and accurately.

2. Eidetic Encoding
The Eidetic Encoding section examines a person's capacity to recognize and remember visual patterns in words. By evaluating this skill, the test can distinguish between deficits in sight-word recognition and deficits in phonetic analysis.

3. Phonetic Encoding
The Phonetic Encoding section assesses an individual's ability to analyze and interpret the phonetic components of words. This section helps identify difficulties in understanding the relationship between letters and their sounds, which is essential for accurate reading.

Purpose
The DESD aims to detect and describe reading problems effectively for both children and adults, enabling educators, parents, and individuals themselves to identify the appropriate educational therapy and support. By providing a comprehensive assessment of a person's reading abilities, the DESD offers valuable insights into specific areas of difficulty and helps develop tailored intervention strategies.
